# DIY Air Quality monitor using an ENS160 and ESP8266 for HomeAssistant
This project demonstrates how to build a CO2 and VOC sensor using the ENS160 sensor and the ESP8266 (Wemos D1 Mini) board, perfect for integrating into your Home Assistant setup. The sensor communicates over WiFi using MQTT, and this repository contains both Arduino and ESPHome code to get you up and running.
